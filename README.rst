MCBrowse 0.1.0-dev.1 - Metacells Browsing
=========================================

Context
-------

The ``mcbrowse`` package provides utilities for browsing the content of metacells data stored in a `daf
<https://pypi.org/project/daf>`_ repository, typically created by using the `metacells
<https://pypi.org/project/metacells>`_ package.

These utilities are meant to be used in two main ways:

* Directly using `plotly <https://pypi.org/project/plotly>`_, either inside `jupyter notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_,
  inside `dash applications <https://dash.plotly.com>`_, or in standalone HTML files; or

* From inside an `R <https://www.r-project.org>`_ environment, using `reticulate
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=reticulate>`_ and (**TODO**) the matching `mcbrowser
  <https://cran.r-project.org/package=mcbrowser>`_ packages (note the ``r`` at the end).

The utilities provided here allow generating figures in distinct steps: (1) extracting the `tidy data
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidy_data>`_ data needed for a specific figure from the overall metacells ``daf``
repository, (2) specifying parameters to control the figure appearance in a veneer object and (3) generating a
``plotly`` figure. The matching R package provides utilities that take the same data and veneer objects (accessed via
``reticulate``) and produce a `ggplot <https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggplot2>`_ figure.

One can use this in a pure script form, manually specifying all the parameters, or one can use the provided jupyter
notebook `ipywidgets <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets>`_ to use a friendly UI to control the parameters.

See the `documentation <https://mcbrowse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_ for the full API details.

Usage
-----

Simple usage in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    import daf
    import mcbrowse

    # Open some metacells data repository.
    data = daf.DafReader(...)

    # Extract the data for a gene-gene figure.
    figure_data = mcbrowse.GeneGeneData(...)

    # Control what the figure will look like.
    figure_veneer = mcbrowse.GeneGeneVeneer(...)

    # Obtain a plotly figure.
    figure = GeneGeneFigure(figure_data, figure_veneer)

    figure.show()

And equivalent usage in R:

.. code-block:: R

    require(reticulate)
    require(mcbrowser)
    require(ggplot2)

    daf <- reticulate::import("daf")
    mcbrowse <- reticulate$import("mcbrowse")

    # Open some metacells data repository.
    data <- daf$DafReader(...)

    # Extract the data for a gene-gene figure.
    figure_data <- mcbrowse$GeneGeneFilter(...).collect()

    # Control what the figure will look like.
    figure_veneer <- mcbrowse$GeneGeneVeneer(...)

    # Obtain a ggplot figure.
    figure = figure_veneer.plot(figure_data)

    print(figure)


Installation
------------

In short: ``pip install mcbrowse``. Note that ``mcbrowse`` requires many "heavy" dependencies, most notably ``daf``
which in turn requires ``numpy``, ``pandas``, ``scipy`` and ``anndata``, all of which ``pip`` should automatically
install for you. If you are running inside a ``conda`` environment, you might prefer to use it to first install these
dependencies, instead of having ``pip`` install them from ``PyPI``.
